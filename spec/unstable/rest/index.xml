      <description>GET /_irc/connections/$server This endpoint will fetch all connections for a given server. This should be called on appservice startup and during outages. The output varies by what detail is set to. A state list will return the same as fetching the connection state, except it will fetch for all connections whereas list will just fetch the list of connections that are open.
Closed connections will not be included in the list and clients are encouraged to use the websocket connection to catch these.</description>
